# Titanic


# Project's Title: This is the name of the project is Titanic Disaster Survival.
# Project Description: This task involves working with the Titanic dataset, which contains
passenger information from the ill-fated Titanic ship. The dataset
includes features such as age, gender, class, and whether passengers
survived or not. As a machine learning intern, your objective is to
build a predictive model that can classify whether a passenger
survived or not based on the available features. This is a binary
classification problem.
# Data Exploration:
Explore data set and check out the datatype and target column to identify
#  Data Preprocessing:
Checked for outliers and handle null values 
# Model Used: 
The model used here is the Logistic Regression that is used for binary classifications problem.Here, we have Survived as a target columns and other columns as features.we have 891 passengers data.Some variables need to be encoded various visualizations are made and at the end the model is formed.
